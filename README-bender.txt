Asuswrt-Bender - build 3.0.0.4.266.24 (12/12/31)
===================================================

About
-----
Asuswrt is the firmware developped by Asus for their newer routers.  They are
also porting it to some of their older models, like the RT-56U and RT-N16.
While originally based on Tomato-RT, Asus has disabled some of the
original Tomato features, and added others.

Asuswrt-bender is spin-off of Asuswrt-merlin (http://github.com/) project dedicated to Ralink based
devices like DSL-N55U.

Due to hardware limitations (8mb flash memory only against 32mb of Broadcom based
devices) we had to develop a lightweight version of the firmware to restore and
add new features like Asuswrt-merlin.
